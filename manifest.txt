This is a basic manifest file
Adding a new change to the file. 


Adding content from my laptop:

As an adjective, manifest is a formal way to say that something is apparent to the senses and is synonymous with evident, apparent, or clear.
If you have strong feelings about something, they will be manifest on your face. A ship or plane's manifest is the list of cargo or passengers
 on a particular trip.
